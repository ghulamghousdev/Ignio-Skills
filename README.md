## Idea
The main idea and struggle behind this project is to provide a means that is considerably good and can provide a place 
where students can learn without having to get into contact like in a class that is happening in a physical environment. 
It will help in such a way that students can be more in charge of managing their time and the things they want to learn 
and teachers will also have the opportunity to teach regardless of being in a class with students with a benefit of 
teaching in a more flexible manner.

## Scope 
Generally the main focus of this project is to define a solution in making a virtual learning hub for everyone. The main idea that 
revolves around the development of this system is to provide a virtual platform where learning and teaching can compete with or 
maybe surpass (in different ways and features) the effectiveness and efficiency of physical and more conservative methods. This 
solution will provide more flexibility and time management to both mentor and students simultaneously without causing any setbacks.
